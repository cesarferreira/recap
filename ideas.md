# Stand up notes

This aims to help me with my stand up notes

## Steps to achieve it

*What would roughly take to achieve it*

---

- [ ]  Docker with ollama
- [ ]  Read all commits from my user in the past X hours
- [ ]  Use deepseek or phi4 (small and fast)
- [ ]  Generate a few topics on all the work I’ve done


---


- this could be really cool to be able to pry into 
    - "what did `cesar` did on 12th of jan?"
    - "What has `cesar` done during December?"
- could be a paid tool (and use GPT)

Based on your README, Recap looks like a great tool for visualizing Git history! Here are some creative feature suggestions that could make it even more interesting:
🎵 Commit Music Generation
Generate a unique musical tune based on commit patterns
Different types of changes (additions/deletions) could map to different notes
Could be a fun way to "hear" the rhythm of your development
🎨 Commit Art Visualization
Generate ASCII art or simple graphics based on commit patterns
Could show commit frequency as a heat map or creative visualization
Different colors/patterns for different types of changes
🏆 Achievement System
Track "achievements" for different Git milestones
Examples:
"Night Owl" - commits after midnight
"Sprint Master" - X commits in Y hours
"Bug Squasher" - commits with "fix" in message
"Team Player" - most collaborative commits
📊 AI Commit Analysis
Analyze commit patterns to provide insights
Suggest best times for productive coding based on history
Identify potential risky commits based on size/timing
Generate commit quality score
🔄 Time Travel Mode
Interactive "playback" of repository evolution
Watch how files changed over time with animation
Could include branching visualization
🌍 Team Geography
Show where commits are coming from globally
Time zone visualization for distributed teams
Could help with understanding team workflow
📱 Slack/Discord Integration
Send daily/weekly recap summaries to team channels
Celebrate achievements automatically
Share interesting commit patterns
🎮 Game Mode
Turn commit history into a simple game
Score points for good commit practices
Compete with team members for best commit habits
🗣️ Natural Language Summary
Generate human-readable summaries of commit periods
"This week you focused mainly on frontend fixes and added three new features..."
🎭 Commit Mood Analysis
Analyze commit messages for sentiment
Track project "mood" over time
Could help identify stressful periods or celebrations
Would you like me to elaborate on any of these ideas? I think the Achievement System or Commit Art Visualization could be particularly fun and relatively straightforward to implement as initial additions!

# New feature ideas:
- Map commit size to note duration (larger commits = longer notes)
- Use different instruments for different file types (.rs, .js, etc.)
- Generate MIDI output that represents:
  - Additions as ascending notes
  - Deletions as descending notes
  - File changes as different instruments
  - Commit size as volume
- Could use the `midly` crate for MIDI generation
- Add a `--play` flag to immediately play the tune
- Allow saving as MIDI file with `--save-music`
