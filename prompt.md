**Stand-up Recap: Updates in the last 24 hours**

- **Commit: Added traceback**  
  Enhanced debugging in key screens (`HealthScreen`, `WayveActiveGuidanceScreen`, `SettingsScreen`) by adding detailed traceback mechanisms. Improved error handling ensures fallback logic redirects to the appropriate screens during failures.

- **Commit: Added Screen Navigator**  
  Introduced `ScreenNavigator`, centralizing screen management logic. This simplifies lifecycle handling, minimizes memory usage, and enables dynamic screen loading when needed.

- **Commit: Fixed Back Navigation**  
  Corrected navigation logic in `HealthScreen` to ensure proper transitions and reliable navigation stack behavior.

- **Commit: RW-1625 Health Page Fix**  
  Resolved an issue where the `HealthScreen` incorrectly appeared at the top of the navigation stack. Adjustments include tagging and referencing screens like `FixedRoutesScreen` and `SettingsScreen` for seamless navigation.
